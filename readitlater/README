READ IT LATER

This is my work-in-progress Google Chrome Browser Extension.
It is meant to provide a simple and quick way of storing the links to the articles for which I
don't have the time to read at the moment.

Currently, the links are stored in <i>localStorage</i> and they are listed in the options page.
